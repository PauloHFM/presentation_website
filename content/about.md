Greetings! I'm Paulo, and I'm delighted you've found your way to my website.

I reside near the beautiful coastline of Brazil, where my days are filled with cooking, learning, exercising, and indulging in YouTube and Netflix. I harbor dreams of living in various places around the world, but as they say, one step at a time!

On the professional front, I'm an experienced Data Engineer with a degree in Engineering Physics. Over the past six years, I've worn multiple hats as a Data Engineer, BI Developer, and Data Analyst.

My academic journey in Engineering Physics was a rollercoaster ride through the intriguing realms of quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, and thermodynamics. Although captivated, I decided to pivot towards the expansive universe of data. However, my fascination with physics persists, and I continue to explore it in my leisure time.

Presently, I utilize my expertise to architect robust data structures, develop efficient ETL pipelines, and implement scalable data processing systems. Beyond the technicalities, I find immense joy in initiating projects, designing solutions, and engaging with stakeholders to understand their needs. My ultimate goal? To solve problems, drive improvement, and if possible, add a touch of happiness to the lives of those involved in the process.

Thank you for stopping by! If you'd like to connect or discuss potential collaborations, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always open to new opportunities. ðŸ˜Š

Cheers! ðŸŒŸ
